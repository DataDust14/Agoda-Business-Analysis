Agoda Business Review For Hotels

This project constructs a relational database for Agoda's hotel analysis, comprising three tables: Hotels, Customers, and Bookings. These tables store essential data like hotel names, prices, ratings, and customer details. Booking information such as check-in/out dates and statuses is also recorded. Using sample datasets, queries unveil insights into average hotel prices, top customers, booking counts, and total revenues, aiding strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.
